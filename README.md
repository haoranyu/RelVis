RelVis - RELATIONSHIP VISUALIZATION BY EMAIL
======
This visualization which is named "RelVis" has been done for CS467 class at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by Motahareh EslamiMehdiabadi, Haoran Yu and J.Taylor Fairbank.
“RelVis” visualizes the relationships of an email user with his/ her contacts during the time by considering the “frequency” of sent and received emails. Solar system visualization has been used here in which the center circle (Sun) is the user and other circles (planets) are the contacts of user’s email.
In this solar system, the number of sent messages by the user to a contact has been demonstrated with the distance between them. Additionally, the number of received messages by the user from a contact has been shown by the radius of its related circle.
How to Use
======
To see the visualization, you should have a PhP server with IMAP. We suggest Xampp as an option. After installing Xampp and IMAP, you should put the RelVis Package on the ‘htdocs’ folder of the Xampp server.
Visualization
======
You can run the visualization by opening the ‘index.php’ page from the RelVis directory of localhost. In this page, you can login with your Gmail account (somebody@gmail.com) and also choose the year you want to start visualization of your emails from. Since downloading and processing your whole email data takes time, we suggest you to choose the year of start not very old if you want to see the visualization quickly.

In the appeared solar system, all of your contacts have been shown on the right sidebar. The solar system will be demonstrated in the middle and you can change the time and its range by moving the timebar. To be more specific, you can choose one or more your favorite contacts to see their behavior more clear. 

There will be also a play/ pause option that let the solar system evolve during time and show the changes dynamically. This option can demonstrate the evolution of your email contacts which helps you to figure out which contacts goes out or comes in during time.
